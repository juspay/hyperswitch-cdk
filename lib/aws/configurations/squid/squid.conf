##### Disable Cache
cache deny all
cache_effective_user squid

##### Remove AWS Checks
acl hasRequest has request
access_log daemon:/var/log/squid/access.log squid hasRequest

##### Allow LocalHost
acl localnet src 127.0.0.1

##### ALB Health Check Support
acl alb_health_check src 10.0.0.0/16  # VPC CIDR range
acl health_check_path urlpath_regex ^/$
acl health_check_path urlpath_regex ^/health$

##### Whitelisted Ports
acl SSL_ports port 443
acl Safe_ports port 80          # http
acl Safe_ports port 443         # https
acl CONNECT method CONNECT

# Uncomment this to allow only whitelisted ports
# Deny requests to certain unsafe ports
#http_access deny !Safe_ports

# Deny CONNECT to other than secure SSL ports
#http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports

##### Only allow cachemgr access from localhost
http_access allow localhost manager
# Deny requests to services running on localhost
#http_access deny to_localhost

##### Allow ALB Health Checks FIRST (before other rules)
http_access allow alb_health_check health_check_path

##### Allow Rules
acl allowed_http_sites dstdomain "/etc/squid/squid.allowed.sites.txt"
# Uncomment this to allow certain domains only
http_access allow allowed_http_sites
#http_access allow localnet
#http_access allow localhost

##### And finally deny all other access to this proxy
# http_access allow all

# Uncomment this to deny all and allow only whitelisted domains
http_access deny all

##### Squid listens on port 80 for ALB compatibility (Amazon Linux 2023 + Squid 6.13)
# Standard HTTP port
http_port 0.0.0.0:80

# Simple HTTP proxy port for standard proxy traffic

# SSL bump configuration disabled - using secure HTTPS tunneling instead
# This provides better security by preserving end-to-end encryption
# HTTPS traffic will be tunneled through CONNECT method

# Cache manager interface for monitoring
http_access allow localhost manager
http_access deny manager
