### Stuff to Do

- [ ] Networking
  - [x] VPC
  - [ ] Subnets
  - [ ] NAT
  - [ ] Route Table
  - [ ] IGW
- [ ] Load Balancers
- [ ] Auto Scaling Groups
- [ ] Launch Templates
- [ ] RDS
- [ ] ElastiCache
- [ ] S3
- [ ] EKS
- [ ] Service Endpoints

### Decisions

- [ ] How should we have the subnet distribution?
  1. Similar to how we currently have in production

### Subnet design

We can consist of 4 Subnets

1. Public Incoming - (consisting of 1 subnet per AZ)
2. DMZ - (consisting of 1 subnet per AZ) (non-public)
3. Application - (consisting of 1 subnet per AZ) (isolated)
4. Storage Layer - (consisting of 1 subnet per AZ) (isolated)
5. Outbound - (consisting of 1 subnet per AZ) (connected to igw)

#### Structure

- api-public (exist in 1)
- envoy (exist in 2)
- external jump (exists in 2)
- EKS exists in (3)
- Internal Jump (3)
- squid (4)
